## INTRODUCTION

LaraCMS is a project aiming to provide a complete CMS platform using *Laravel 4.2*. This project is a playground for us and, you can also add value to it. This blueprint we are trying to make will contain a full administrative control for the CMS.

We're focused on using SOLID and best practices to provide the best solution. 

More information, soon.
